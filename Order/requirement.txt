Order Management System
This Java program represents a basic structure of an order management system. It models relationships between Customers, Employees, and Orders.

Each order (Order) is linked to: a customer (Customer), a contact person (Employee), a sale price

The program logic demonstrates how to: 1. Create orders 2. Assign a contact person to an order

Note that  a customer always works with the same employee.
