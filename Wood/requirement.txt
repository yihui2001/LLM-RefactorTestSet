Welcome to Old Oak Lumber Mill. We are a small, handcrafted lumber shop located on the edge of a bustling city, run by a friendly woodworker named Allison. We only trade in the highest quality wood. However, our wood degrades in Grade over time as it stays in storage.

We have an automated system in place that updates our lumber inventory at the end of each day. It was developed by a no-nonsense developer named Leeroy, who has since left to chop trees deep in the forest. Your task is to add support for a new category of wood.

Hereâ€™s how the current system works:

Every piece of log (wood) has a StorageDays value, which indicates how many days remain before it must be used or sold.

Every log also has a Grade value, which indicates its quality.

At the end of each day, the system decreases both StorageDays and Grade for each log.

Once the storage period expires (StorageDays < 0), the Grade of the log degrades twice as fast.

The Grade of a log is never negative.

Seasoned Oak is a special type of wood that actually improves in Grade the longer it ages.

The Grade of any log can never exceed 100.

Ancient Redwood, being a legendary wood, never needs to be sold and never degrades in Grade.

Event Cedar is a rare wood used for special events. Its Grade increases as the event approaches:

Grade increases by 2 when there are 30 days or fewer

Grade increases by 3 when there are 10 days or fewer

Grade drops to 0 after the event (when StorageDays < 0)
