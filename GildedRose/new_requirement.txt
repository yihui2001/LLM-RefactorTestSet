We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

"Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.
